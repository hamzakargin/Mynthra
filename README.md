## About Mynthra 🍃

**Mynthra** is a modern dark VSCode theme designed for developers who value clarity and visual harmony in their coding environment. Built with the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem in mind, it provides carefully crafted syntax highlighting that enhances code readability without sacrificing aesthetics.

### Two Variants, One Vision 🍂

- **Mynthra** — The classic variant with a deeper, darker background and mint-green accents that keep your code crisp and focused
- **Mynthra Vaporwave** — A softer, pale dark variant specifically designed for Angular development with adjusted syntax highlighting

Both variants share the same philosophy: reduce eye strain during extended coding sessions while maintaining excellent syntax distinction for JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JSON.

---

## Key Features

- **Optimized for JavaScript/TypeScript** — Syntax colors designed specifically for modern web development
- **Framework-friendly** — Works beautifully with React, Next.js, Angular, and Node.js projects
- **Eye-comfort focused** — Balanced contrast that reduces fatigue during long sessions
- **Clean UI elements** — Minimalist sidebar, terminal, and editor chrome
- **Consistent highlighting** — Predictable color patterns across different file types
